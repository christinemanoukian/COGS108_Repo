However, when computers perform calculations, the work is usually done on binary (base-2) numbers. To help demonstrate why these seemingly small optimization actually make a much more significant difference when used for multiplying two binary numbers, consider a number $(123)_{10} = (1111011)_{2}$. If we were to multiply this number by $(10)_{10}$ to get $(1230)_{10}$ (thus adding 1 digit), by how many digits would the binary representation increase? Hint: You can, if you want, use an online base converter to find what $(1230)_{10}$ is equal to in binary to answer this question.\n",

If we had some number $(n)_{10} = (b)_{2}$ and we multiplied it by $(10)_{10}$ (thus adding 1 digit), by how many digits would the binary representation $b$ increase? Give your answer rounded to 2 decimal places. Hint: This can be computed using log.\n",
        "9. Recall how the runtime for the FOIL method was found using the master theorem for the recurrence relation $T(n) = 4T(n/2)+O(n)$, and the runtime for Karatsuba multiplication used the recurrence relation $T(n)=3T(n/2)+O(n)$. Using the code you finished the implementation of, justify what the $a, b, d$ in the master theorem here represent in terms of the actual algorithm itself (e.g. why is $a$ in the FOIL method 4, but it's $3$ for Karatsuba mult). With those descriptions in mind, why does a recurrence relation like $T(n)=\\frac{1}{2}T(n/2)+O(n)$, despite technically fitting the format of the master theorem, not actually make sense in the context of a real recursive algorithm?\n",
